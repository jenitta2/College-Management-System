>College Management System

**Idea generation:**

As I had got an opportunity to create applications in Zoho creator, I decided to go on with College Management System as I had previous experience as a user in Laudea, PSGCAS official student portal. 

My mentor at Zitraar Technologies guided me throughout the learning process by providing me guidance and resources. So, I build a minimal college management system.

**Components:**

1. Organisation level: Contains details about Correspondent and Principal.
2. Staff level: Contains detail about Teaching and Non-teaching staffs.
3. Student level:To enroll themselves in club related events and to pay their exam fees.

**Application used:**

I used Zoho creator as the application development platform. It is a low code application developing platform.
